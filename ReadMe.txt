Hello and thank you for downloading Critter!

Critter is inspired by the Nokia Phone Snake Game. There is a classic version and a Critter version that has added obstacles and power-ups.

Desktop Controls

WASD and Arrow Keys for movement. The escape key pauses the game.

Tap on the screen for the snake to move in that direction. Lowering the app will pause the game.

I hope you enjoy your time playing the game!
